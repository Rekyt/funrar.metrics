# funrar.metrics

The goal of funrar metrics is to be a companion to Functional Rarity indices by understanding the links between species traits and functional rarity indices.

We may obtain different indices depending on the nature and the number of traits.

## Installation

You can install the released version of funrar.metrics from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("funrar.metrics")
```

## Running the workflow

The `funrar.metrics` workflow uses the [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) package to be fully reproducible.
You can rerun the workflow using the following code:

``` r
## basic example code
```
